        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish celebrated for its comforting layers and rich flavors. At its heart are wide, flat sheets of pasta, also called 
            lasagna, which are layered with a variety of ingredients. Traditionally, this includes a meat-based ragù or a tomato sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, 
            and an assortment of cheeses such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. These components are carefully assembled in a baking dish, creating multiple 
            strata of pasta, sauce, and cheese, often interspersed with vegetables or meats. Once assembled, the dish is baked until the pasta is tender, the 
            sauces are bubbly, and the cheese topping is golden and melted, resulting in a substantial and satisfying meal with a delightful combination of 
            textures and tastes.

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente according to package instructions. 
                Drain the noodles and lay them flat to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato or meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if needed to cover the bottom of the dish.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of ricotta cheese evenly over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of tomato or meat sauce over the ricotta.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the tomato/meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a portion of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the béchamel.</li>
            <li>Place another layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>
                Repeat the layering process with ricotta, tomato/meat sauce, béchamel, and mozzarella until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of 
                noodles topped with the remaining tomato/meat sauce, béchamel, and generously sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>

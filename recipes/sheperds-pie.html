        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Shepherd's Pie is a classic comfort food originating from the British Isles, characterized by its hearty layers. The base consists of a rich and 
            savory filling made from ground meat (traditionally lamb, giving it the "shepherd" name, though beef is also common in what's sometimes called 
            Cottage Pie) cooked with vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery in a flavorful gravy often seasoned with herbs and Worcestershire sauce. 
            This meat and vegetable mixture is then generously topped with a thick, creamy layer of mashed potatoes. The dish is baked until the potato topping 
            is beautifully golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbling, creating a satisfying contrast between the tender interior and the slightly crusted 
            potato surface. It's a warming and substantial meal, perfect for cooler weather.

            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk or cream</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <em>Make the Mashed Potatoes:</em> Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in a pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and 
                cook until fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the hot pot. Add the milk or cream and butter. Mash until 
                smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>
                <em>Make the Meat Filling:</em> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery and cook 
                until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic, dried thyme, and dried rosemary and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the all-purpose flour and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, stirring to combine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>
                Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Stir in the frozen peas if using. Season the filling 
                with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li><em>Assemble the Pie:</em> Pour the meat and vegetable filling into an oven-safe baking dish.</li>
            <li>
                Spoon or spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of the meat filling, covering it completely. You can use a fork to create peaks in 
                the mashed potatoes for extra browning.
            </li>
            <li>If desired, sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese over the mashed potato topping.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Bake the Pie:</em> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the mashed potato topping is golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>Let the pie rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Chicken stir-fry is a vibrant and dynamic dish known for its quick preparation and fresh flavors. It typically features tender pieces of chicken 
            rapidly cooked alongside a colorful assortment of vegetables such as crisp broccoli, vibrant bell peppers, and crunchy carrots. The ingredients are 
            tossed together in a hot pan or wok with a savory sauce, often a blend of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and a touch of sweetness. The high-heat cooking 
            method ensures the vegetables retain a pleasant bite while the chicken becomes succulent. Served piping hot, usually over fluffy rice, chicken 
            stir-fry offers a delightful combination of textures and a balanced profile of salty, sweet, and sometimes spicy notes.

            <li>2-3 cups mixed vegetables, such as broccoli florets, carrots (sliced or julienned), bell peppers (sliced), snap peas, or snow peas</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey or sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil (vegetable or canola)</li>
            <li>Optional: Red pepper flakes, sliced green onions, sesame seeds for garnish</li>
            <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey or sugar, cornstarch, minced garlic, and grated ginger to create the 
                stir-fry sauce. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>
                Add the sliced chicken to the hot skillet and cook until browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally. Remove the cooked chicken from the 
                skillet and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil to the skillet. Add the vegetables and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender.</li>
            <li>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Stir the prepared sauce again and pour it over the chicken and vegetables in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and coats the ingredients, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve hot over cooked rice.</li>
        </ol>
